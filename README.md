# Solana Trading Bot

## 1 Volume bot 
It controls the token volume. It buys and sells tokens from multiple wallets and increases the token volume.
The token volume is related to the buy, sell amount and the number of accounts.
The bot uses these values.
The operation fee is 20 soles per day.

## 3 Snipping Bot
It monitors when the pool is created and buys tokens when the token price is the lowest. Later, when the token price goes up, the bot automatically sells them.
The risk is when the token does not go up.
So we have to decide the token well.

I have developed a copy trading bot that monitors a specific wallet and does the same thing when creating a trade.
I mean the special wallet is a community member wallet.
Because the community members are well informed about the token launch.
